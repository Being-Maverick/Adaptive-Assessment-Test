# Adaptive-Assessment-Test
This is a mini project in Java, in which a console application is developed to conduct an adaptive assessment test for a user.
This project comprises of 6 java files all of which are compiled and tested using JDK 11 and IDE IntelliJ IDEA. In the test, a user
is asked to enter his name and email-id. Then, one by one ten questions are displayed, prompting the user for an answer. Depending, on the
answer, whether it is correct or not, the level of next question is determined(Easy, Medium or Hard). At the end, a graph of 
marks vs question is displayed, showing how level of questions progressed throughout the test.

To run the application, create a new project and then create a new package com.charchit in your project. Add all the files to your project 
and execute the Main.java file.

OR

You can also create a package of another suitable name in your project. Just replace com.charchit with the new name in all the files.
